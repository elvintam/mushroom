# Introduction

In this report, our goal is to predict the edibility (class: edible / poisonous) of mushroom basing on attribution information. Data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). The reason of selecting this dataset is that this problem is related to classification which is a large part of application in data science. And, it is also a complement to project – MovieLens that we can cover each part of what we have learnt from the course.

The mushroom dataset has already been well formatted from the source already. Data cleaning is only applied by removing 2 attributes prior to splitting the data to training set and test set. 10 algorithms are applied and an ensemble model combining the prior 10 different algorithms to see if it can provide improvement to our predictions.

# 1. Data Cleaning

Mushroom data set contains 23 columns of 1 class and 22 attributes related to cap, bruises, odor, gill, stalk, veil, ring, spore color, population and habitat. According to description from the source, there is data missing in column stalk root. The missing data point is marked “?” from the source already. Veil type is reported 1 attribute only. Both stalk root and veil type is removed prior to following steps.

class, cap_shape, cap_surface,cap_color, bruises, odor, gill_attachment, gill_spacing, gill_size, gill_color, stalk_shape, stalk_root, stalk_surface_above_ring, stalk_surface_below_ring, stalk_color_above_ring, stalk_color_below_ring, veil_type, veil_color, ring_number, ring_type, spore_print_color, population, habitat

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
